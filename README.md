# Learn C Programing course
My solutions to the exercises from a 10-hour tutorial course on C that is based on the classic book by Kernighan and Ritchie. 
Teached by Dr. Charles Severance, the course can be found on Youtube where it is hosted by the freecodecamp channel.
As I follow along the tutorial, I plan to code all the exercises to get more proficient with the C programming language, delve deeper into concepts of computer science and become a better developer.
